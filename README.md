# 🛒 ShopStop – Outlet Management System

### Overview
**ShopStop** is a database-driven Outlet Management System designed to integrate inventory management, sales processing, supplier handling, employee supervision, and customer loyalty tracking into a single unified platform.

Many retail shops still rely on manual records or disconnected tools (billing software, Excel sheets, separate loyalty apps), which leads to:
* **Stock shortages** or over-ordering
* **Poor visibility** of real-time inventory
* **Inefficient** supplier management
* **Difficulty tracking** customer rewards
* **Manual or error-prone** staff record handling

ShopStop aims to eliminate these issues by providing a structured and scalable relational database system.

### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust relational database schema that:
* Ensures data integrity and normalization
* Enforces business rules and constraints
* Maintains referential integrity
* Supports real-world retail workflows
* Bridges conceptual modelling (ER design) with SQL implementation


-----
### Core Functionalities (Current Scope)
* **Sales & Billing:** Comprehensive management of transactions.
* **Inventory Tracking:** Real-time stock monitoring and restock alerts.
* **Procurement:** Supplier and purchase order management.
* **CRM:** Customer membership and loyalty system.
* **Marketing:** Promotion and discount handling.
* **HR:** Employee hierarchy and accountability tracking.


-----
### Tech Stack
* **Database:** MySQL (Relational Database)
* **Modelling:** ER Modelling (Crow’s Foot Notation)
* **Integrity:** SQL Constraints (PK, FK, CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)

------

### 🚧 Project Status
This project is currently **under development** as part of a database systems assignment. 

The schema design, integrity constraints, and conceptual modelling (ER design) are implemented. Further refinements and enhancements will continue in future iterations.
